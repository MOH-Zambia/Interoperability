# Ministry of Health Interoperability Project

The project will seek to develop and implement an interoperability framework and test it with at least two system currently being used by the ministry of health

Interoperability is defined as the ability of different information technology systems and software applications to communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged. Interoperability is important in the eHealth domain to increase the quality of healthcare and to decrease costs. There are several real life cases that will benefit from interoperability, such as being able to share lifelong EHRs of patients among different healthcare providers from different health information systems; providing clinical decision support through the use of clinical guidelines which require the interoperability of Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRs), aggregating information collected by different players in health for public health management and enabling secondary use of EHRs for clinical research.
